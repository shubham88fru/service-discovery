Intuition for implementation
----------------------------
- Upon connection to zookeeper, each node will create an ephemeral znode under the service registry parent's znode,
and store its address in the znode for others to see.
- Then, any node which is interested in getting the address of any other node will simply subscribe and call the
`getChildren()` on service registry's znode to get the list all znodes (effectively address of all the nodes) and connect
with the node that it desires to.
